# variables

# first_name = 'Max';
# last_name = "Mezalon"
# age = 31
# new_age = age+1

# full_name = first_name +" "+ last_name
# int cannot store integers and float can store decimals
# height = 300.5# this would be a float
# print("hello, " + full_name)

# print(f"My height is {height} cm")

# to check the type of a variable use the type function in front of the variable
# print(type(name))

# print(f"My name is {full_name}")
# print(f"my age is {age}")

# to convert an int into a str we use - str(some_int) => some_int will now be a string
# you would do the same thing for a bool if you are concatenning it with a string str(some_bool)

# print("next year I will be " + str(new_age) + " years old")

################ multiple assignment

# name, age, tall = "Max",  31, True
# # if all the variables are all equals we would type it like this
# spongebob = skuitward = sandy = 30
# print(f"squitward age is {skuitward} and so is spongebob and sandy. SB - {spongebob} Sandy - {sandy}")
# print(f"I assign all of these variables in one line: {name} is {age} and it is {tall} that he is tall")

################# some usefull method for str


name = "max"
#length
# print(len(name))

#find
# print(name.find("x"))

#capitalize
# print(name.capitalize())

#uppercase and lowercase
# print(name.upper()) # print(name.lower())

#.isdigit() => true or false

#isalpha => to check if it is only alphabetical letters

#count
# print(name.count('a')) => 1

#replace
# print(name.replace("m", "M")) => "Max"

#multplier
# print(name*3) => "maxmaxmax"
